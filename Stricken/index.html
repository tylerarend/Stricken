			<h2>Author's Summary</h2>
			<p>"Music has a way of bringing people together. It has the ability to get inside you and heal the wounds you hide from the world. It can be cathartic, life changing, it can move you to dance, to sing, scream and cry, to push and shove and fight your way through life. Music can be fuel for the fire that burns within or it can calm that same storm that thunders inside your mind. There were few things Chester expected to happen in his life. See a few shows, go to work, do some grocery shopping, maybe meet his favorite band someday, drink, and play some music with his friends."</p>
			<br>
			<p>"The American dream. Simple, boring. One day he walks out his front door and his plans of a mundane afternoon ending in another drunken night are thwarted by a 10-year-old girl found wandering the streets alone. He finds himself sucked into a horrific mess of human trafficking and crime unlike anything he ever witnessed before. A door he never wanted to open gets blasted off its hinges. Forcing him to face that which he fears the most. Sometimes the dark events of the past refuse to stay there. The things music saved you from are thrown in your face one day. Leaving you no choice but to face it."</p>

	  				<q>Excellent book! This book keeps your attention and keeps you wanting to read more to find out what happens next. It's an interesting, mysterious, and action packed story with villains, victims, and heroes. The story also shows how music and art can be an outlet and escape that helps people get through hard times in their lives. It also tells a story of how the kindness of a stranger sometimes can come when least expected and change lives for the better. Great book! I would give it more than five stars if I could!</q>

	 			 	<q>This book takes you up and down and all around! When you think it's going to zig, it zags. The thing that struck me the most is the resilience of the main character's basic human kindness in the face of so much ugliness and downright evil. Chester is not perfect, but he's decent and loving at his core. 10/10 Would recommend!</q>

	  				<q>This book, WOW! Once you dive in it's impossible to put down. I personally got attached to the characters and every emotion in the pages was felt. The story conveys that there is comfort in music and heroes really do exist, even when they come in an unlikely form.</q>
